# core
Code that I deemed essential for my projects at one point.

## How to use in your project with maven
For now, sporniket-core is not deployed in a public repository. One MUST clone the repository, build and install.

```
git clone https://github.com/sporniket/core.git
cd core/sporniket-core
mvn install
```
