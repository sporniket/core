/**
 * Parser for properties file supporting multiple-line declaration using heredoc convention.
 * 
 * <p>The parsing is event based, and consists of a line processor that notify listeners when a property is completed : one should use e.g. a {@link java.io.LineNumberReader} to read a source line by line, give the line to the parser and listen to events to get each parsed properties.</p>
